        fellrace.org.uk
      provides free sites for fell races.
      Each race gets an address like
      %a.sample{href: "/races/caw"} caw.fellrace.org.uk
      and a set of editing and map-drawing tools that will get you up and running in a few minutes.
      It&rsquo;s built purely for fell races, by
      %a{href: "/faq/about"} three fell runners
      who like maps and are trying very hard to avoid doing their real work.
    %p.warning
      It's quite an old site now but we are updating it
      whenever time allows, so the brave and patient can still
      %a.sign_up_for_event 
        get a race page here
